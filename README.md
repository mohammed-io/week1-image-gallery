# Week1 Image Gallery

This project is a gallery portfolio for a local photographer.

The website should include introdcution page, and a dashboard where you can add and modify the photos (referencing the photo with url, no need for uploading), also photos should have categories (nature, architecture...etc). The portfolio is used by only one user, so no need for multi-user functionality.

The planning and running of the project should be done with Trello (One Sprint plan), and the team should be added to Trello board.
